# CrawlerMv

The year was 2017. Originally was a tool to crawl and obtain the script to the
online demo for Winds of Change. The online demo no longer exists. The library
might still work on other RPG Maker MV based games, but it doesn't really
account for any features that weren't in the Winds of Change demo or
Major\Minor (including Definitive Edition.)

This code does not contain an executable component at current; you will need
an IDE such as Visual Studio or Rider and run one of the applicable NUnit test
cases in order to see the output. The output is written to the desktop.
