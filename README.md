# CrawlerMv

The year was 2017. Originally was a tool to crawl and obtain the script to the online demo for Winds of Change. This version of the game is nowhere to be found these days. The library might still work on other RPG Maker MV based games, but it doesn't really account for any features that weren't in that or Major\Minor.

This code does not contain an executable component at current; you will need an IDE such as Visual Studio or Rider and run one of the applicable NUnit test cases in order to see the output. The output is written to the desktop.
